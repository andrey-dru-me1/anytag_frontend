# Git Workflow Guide

This document outlines the Git workflow and conventions for the anytag_frontend project. Following these guidelines ensures consistent collaboration, clean commit history, and efficient code review processes.

> **YouTrack Integration**: All work must be linked to a YouTrack ticket. Every branch name, commit message, and pull request must include the corresponding ticket ID (e.g., `ANY-1234`). The YouTrack instance is available at [https://lightsoff.mooo.com/yt](https://lightsoff.mooo.com/yt).

## Branch Strategy

We follow a simplified Git Flow approach with two main long-lived branches:

### Main Branches

1. **`master`** - Production-ready code
   - Always stable and deployable
   - Contains tagged releases
   - Protected branch (no direct pushes)

2. **`develop`** - Integration branch for features
   - Contains completed features ready for next release
   - Should be stable and pass all tests
   - Protected branch (no direct pushes)

### Supporting Branches

All development happens in feature branches branched from `develop`:

- **Feature branches** (`feature/*`) - New functionality
- **Bugfix branches** (`bugfix/*`) - Bug fixes for upcoming release
- **Hotfix branches** (`hotfix/*`) - Critical production fixes (branched from `master`)
- **Chore branches** (`chore/*`) - Documentation or maintenance changes
- **Release branches** (`release/*`) - Release preparation (branched from `develop`)

## Branch Naming Conventions

Use lowercase with hyphens for separation. **Always include the YouTrack ticket ID** after the branch type prefix:

```txt
feature/ANY-1234-add-user-authentication
bugfix/ANY-5678-fix-null-pointer-exception
hotfix/ANY-9012-critical-security-patch
chore/update-cargo-deps
release/v1.2.0
```

> Release and small chore branches do not require a ticket ID.

## Commit Message Guidelines

### Format

```txt
<type>(<ticket-id>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

> The ticket ID (e.g., `ANY-1234`) must be placed in parentheses after the type.

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring (no functional changes)
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks, dependencies, build scripts

### Subject Rules

- Use imperative mood: "Add" not "Adds" or "Added"
- Start with capital letter
- No period at the end
- Keep under 50 characters

### Examples

```txt
feat(ANY-1234): Add user authentication middleware
fix(AT-5678): Resolve database connection timeout
docs(AT-9012): Update API endpoint documentation
refactor(AT-3456): Simplify error handling in handlers
```

### Body (Optional)

- Explain what and why, not how
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Use bullet points for multiple changes

### Footer (Optional)

- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`
- YouTrack ticket reference (if not already in subject): `See ANY-1234`
- Breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: <description>`

## Pull Request Workflow

### Creating a Pull Request

1. **Create feature branch** from `develop`:

   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make changes** and commit following conventions:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(ANY-1234): Add new endpoint for user profiles"
   ```

3. **Push to remote**:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Create PR** on GitHub:
   - Target: `develop` branch
   - Use template if available
   - Link related issues

### PR Title Format

```txt
[Type] TICKET-ID: Brief description of changes
```

> The YouTrack ticket ID must be included after the type, separated by a colon.

Examples:

```txt
[Feature] ANY-1234: Add user authentication
[Bugfix] AT-5678: Resolve memory leak in database pool
[Refactor] AT-3456: Simplify error handling middleware
```

### PR Description Template

```markdown
## Description

Brief description of the changes.

## Changes Made

- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3

## Testing

- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing performed

## Related Issues

Closes ANY-123
Fixes ANY-456

## Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] No breaking changes introduced
```

## Code Review Process

### For Reviewers

1. **Be specific**: Reference lines and suggest alternatives
2. **Check requirements**: Ensure PR meets acceptance criteria
3. **Test locally** if significant changes

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive and pass
- [ ] Documentation is updated if needed
- [ ] Performance considerations addressed
- [ ] Error handling is appropriate

### For Authors

1. **Address all feedback** before requesting re-review
2. **Resolve conversations** - The person who started a conversation should resolve it when the issue is addressed
3. **Keep PR focused** - one feature/bug per PR
4. **Rebase if needed** to resolve conflicts
5. **Squash commits** if requested

## Merging Strategy

We use the following merge strategies, listed in descending priority:

- **Merge commit** — if there are no merge conflicts
- **Merge commit with conflicts resolved on GitHub** — if resolving conflicts via the GitHub UI is convenient
- **Local rebase, force push, then merge commit** — if resolving conflicts across the entire branch history is manageable
- **Locally merge the target branch into the work branch, then merge commit** — otherwise

## Common Workflows

### Starting a New Feature

```bash
# Update local develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch with ticket ID
git checkout -b feature/ANY-1234-feature-description

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat(ANY-1234): Add feature description"

# Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/ANY-1234-feature-description
```

### Updating Feature Branch with Latest Develop

```bash
# From feature branch
git checkout feature/feature-name

# Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin

# Rebase onto develop
git rebase origin/develop

# Resolve conflicts if any
# Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# Force push (since history changed)
git push -f
```

### Creating a Hotfix

```bash
# From master
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Create hotfix branch with ticket ID
git checkout -b hotfix/AT-9012-critical-security-patch

# Make urgent fix
git add .
git commit -m "fix(AT-9012): Critical security patch"

# Push and create PR to master AND develop
git push -u origin hotfix/AT-9012-critical-security-patch
```

## Best Practices

### Do's

- ✅ Keep branches up-to-date with base branch
- ✅ Write descriptive commit messages
- ✅ Make small, focused PRs (300-500 lines max)
- ✅ Review your own code before requesting review
- ✅ Run tests before pushing
- ✅ Use `.gitignore` appropriately

### Don'ts

- ❌ Commit directly to `master` or `develop`
- ❌ Force push to shared branches
- ❌ Leave PRs open for extended periods without updates
- ❌ Merge your own PR without at least one review
- ❌ Commit large binary files
- ❌ Break the build

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Merge conflicts:**

```bash
# Update local branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/develop

# Resolve conflicts, then
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

**Accidental commit to wrong branch:**

```bash
# Create new branch with the commit
git branch feature/correct-branch

# Reset original branch
git checkout original-branch
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Need to amend last commit:**

```bash
git commit --amend
# Edit message or add forgotten files
git push -f  # Only if not pushed yet or on your own branch
```

## Tools and Automation

### Git Hooks

Consider setting up pre-commit hooks for:

- Code formatting (`dart format`)
- Linting (`flutter analyze`)
- Commit message validation
- Running tests

### GitHub Actions

Automated checks should include:

- Build status
- Test execution
- Code coverage
- Linting results
